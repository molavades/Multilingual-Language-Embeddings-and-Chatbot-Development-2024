# Multilingual Chatbot and Embedding Training

## Overview  

This project explores the training of multilingual language embeddings and their application in building chatbots. By leveraging custom embeddings generated through **Word2Vec**, **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, and **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)**, the project evaluates their effectiveness in understanding and responding to user inputs in a conversational AI setting.

## Objectives  
1. **Train Language Embeddings:**  
   - Utilize **Word2Vec** for foundational embeddings.  
2. **Develop RNN-based Embeddings:**  
   - Train embeddings using RNNs to demonstrate improved sequential and contextual understanding.  
3. **Build a Chatbot:**  
   - Develop a chatbot using trained embeddings and compare its performance across models.  
4. **Evaluate Embedding Quality:**  
   - Use tasks like word similarity, analogy tests, and chatbot accuracy to assess the performance of embeddings.  
5. **Implement DNN-based Model:**  
   - Train a shallow DNN to develop embeddings and compare results with other methods.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of RNN-based embeddings in capturing sequential dependencies, making them more effective for chatbot applications. While Word2Vec embeddings provide a reliable baseline, DNN embeddings act as an efficient alternative with competitive results. The chatbot's superior performance with RNN embeddings underscores the potential for building contextually aware conversational AI in Hindi.
